# Random JavaScript Projects

This repository contains various beginner-level JavaScript projects that I created to practice and improve my coding skills.  
Each project is standalone and focuses on implementing core JavaScript concepts along with HTML and CSS.  

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to build small projects regularly to strengthen my JavaScript skills, explore new features, and experiment with different design approaches.
